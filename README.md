# Cat and Dog Image Classification Model

## Overview

This repository contains code for a simple cat and dog image classification model using Python and Keras. The model is built with the help of the following modules:

- `numpy` for numerical operations.
- `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
- `keras.preprocessing.image` for image data preprocessing.
- `keras.utils` for converting labels to categorical format.
- `sklearn.model_selection` for splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `matplotlib.pyplot` for data visualization.
- `random` for generating random numbers.
